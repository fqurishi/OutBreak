# OutBreak
My original 8bit retro styled game

Created original game from scratch in C++ using SFML library. Sound included. Will work only if you have OpenAl32.dll on your machine.
(Can work without sound if you have the .dll file in the same directory as the .exe file of the game)

Feel free to checkout code and try it out for yourself.
Download .exe files in /Outbreak/bin/Release/
Current release is version 1.0
